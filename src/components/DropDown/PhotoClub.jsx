              <span>TINT Photography Club is the official photography club of Techno International New Town, where the photo enthusiasts of the college try to nurture their creativity and disclose the subtle richness of reality through their images. It is one of the most popular clubs of the college and acts as a mantle to voice the feelings and ideas of students through photography, which is amongst the most modern visual art forms.</span>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
            The honourable Director of Techno International New Town, Prof. (Dr.) R.T. Goswami and the venerable Registrar of the college, Prof. (Dr.) S.P. Ghosh have always nurtured an environment in the college where culture with all its branches can flourish radiantly. It was their endeavour to maintain such an environment that led to the germination of the idea for a photography club in the college. This idea gained ground as our beloved MD Dr. Satyam Roychowdhury has always encouraged the creation of platforms so that students can express themselves outside their academic activities. He lent his support to the initiative of our honourable Director and Registrar.

          Life is built up with a tableau of experiences and perceptions that make us what we are. Therefore, while the college primarily seeks to excel in the field of technical disciplines, it ensures that the individuality and creativity of the students are kept alive by nurturing the passion within. It is with this vision that the club began its long walk. Be it nature, wildlife, portrait, street or fashion photography, advertisement, journalism or any other camera skill â€“ the club yearns to aid students in every possible way to nurture their skills and yet keep alive the individuality of each student in terms of style.
